# Probability Calculator
Calculates A and B event chances.  
Calculates chance of x occuring y times over z times(Binomial).

## Why

I made this out of frustration of how I can never find the right probability calculator. So I combined the two I occasionally use. I will probably add more as I remember. There's no accomodation for Mobile currently, and it isn't checked for weird cases or bugs. The idea for it is simply to vent out my frustrations.
